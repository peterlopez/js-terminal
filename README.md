# JS Terminal

Easily build an interactive terminal into your website. By leveraging existing DOM elements, this plugin will transform them into a fun and fully customizable command line. Utilizing Javascript and jQuery these scripts will provide an input/output system for users to interact with your website using commands you have setup. Setting up scripts is [not currently] easy but can be done by writing some Javascript or jQuery code and having it executed upon request of your users.
