# JS Terminal

Easily build an interactive terminal into your website with this jQuery plugin. By leveraging existing DOM elements, this plugin will transform them into a fun and fully customizable command line. Utilizing Javascript and jQuery this script provides an input/output system for users to interact with your website using commands you have setup. Setting up scripts is [not currently] easy but can be done by writing some Javascript or jQuery code and having it executed upon request of your users.

## Requirements & Installation

1. Make sure [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download/) is loaded on the page
2. Download `js-terminal.min.js` and move it somewhere accessible to your markup
3. Load `js-terminal.min.js` (after jQuery) like so:

```html
<!-- Load jQuery -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>

<!-- Load JS Terminal plugin -->
<script src='path/to/js-terminal.min.js'></script>

## Usage

Be forewarned that this plugin is still in early development. Meaning, it is built specific to my needs. I welcome you to `git checkout feature/demo` and see how you could potentially use it. My source code is ~~perfect~~ well documented. 

Check back soon for documentation on how to integrate this into your project.

## Contributing

 If you're interested in checkout out my source code while I'm finishing an API for it:
 
 1. `$ git clone {URL}`
 2. `$ git checkout -b develop origin/develop`

I admire your spirit and willingness to contribute and help this project become more functional, robust, and enjoyable! This is some of the most fun I've ever had with code, be it Javascript or any other programming language.

Here are some points before getting started:

* While, my code works and is clean, it's not easily integratabtle with some projects.
* I tried to make these solutions as clear as daylight; although, I know there are many uses which I'm ignoring (hopefully not yours).
* Also, keep in mind, the commands I currently have integrated into the source code are pretty specifically fun to me. Not ashamed to say :)
* Feel free to dig around and change what you want.
