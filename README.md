# JS Terminal

Easily build an interactive terminal into your website. By leveraging existing DOM elements, this plugin will transform them into a fun and fully customizable command line. Utilizing Javascript and jQuery these scripts will provide an input/output system for users to interact with your website using commands you have setup. Setting up scripts is [not currently] easy but can be done by writing some Javascript or jQuery code and having it executed upon request of your users.

*There is no API built yet but check back soon.*

## Contributing

 If you're interested in checkout out my source code while I'm finishing an API for it:
 
 1. `$ git clone {URL}`
 2. `$ git checkout -b develop origin/develop`

I admire your spirit and willingness to contribute to help this project become more enjoyable! This is some of the most fun I've ever had with code, be it Javascript or any other programming language.

Here are some points before getting started:

* While, my code works and is clean, it's not easily integratabtle with some projects.
* I tried to make these solutions as clear as daylight; although, I know there are many uses which I'm ignoring (hopefully not yours).
* Also, keep in mind, the commands I currently have integrated into the source code are pretty specifically fun to me. Not ashamed to say :)
* Feel free to dig around and change what you want.

**If you have or want to improve something please send me a message or pull request!**
